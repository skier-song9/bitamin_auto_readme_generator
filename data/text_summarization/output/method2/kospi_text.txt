<sub>Model Introduction</sub> <content>XGBoost, LSTM, and GRU models are introduced for predicting the KOSPI index through feature importance analysis.</content> <page>1</page>
<sub>Data Preprocessing</sub> <content>Data merging was performed based on various indices and commodities, with adjustments made to date formats and handling of missing values using forward fill methods.</content> <page>2</page>
<sub>XGBoost Model</sub> <content>The model utilizes a decision tree as the base learner, achieving fast processing and strong prediction performance, with hyperparameter tuning resulting in an accuracy of 0.5518.</content> <page>3</page>
<sub>LSTM Model</sub> <content>Two LSTM layers are employed alongside dropout to prevent overfitting, effectively addressing long-term dependencies in time series data.</content> <page>4</page>
<sub>GRU Model</sub> <content>Similar to LSTM, the GRU model utilizes gating mechanisms for important information retention while efficiently managing long-term dependencies.</content> <page>5</page>
<sub>Feature Importance Analysis</sub> <content>Attention and SHAP methods are employed to evaluate feature importance, revealing insights into the significant variables affecting model predictions.</content> <page>6</page>
<sub>Results Comparison</sub> <content>XGBoost shows superior performance over LSTM and GRU, particularly with the use of rate of change data, which enhances prediction accuracy by reducing noise and capturing trends effectively.</content> <page>7</page>
<sub>Conclusion</sub> <content>The study concludes that using rate of change data, supported by attention mechanisms, improves predictive performance in stock price forecasting, allowing for effective feature selection with fewer variables.</content> <page>8</page>
